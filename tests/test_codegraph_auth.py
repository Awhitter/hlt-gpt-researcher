"""Perimeter tests for the codegraph sidecar.

`hlt-codegraph` exposes `gitnexus query` over five private repositories on a
service whose Render ipAllowList is 0.0.0.0/0. Its auth middleware used to
return `await call_next(request)` when the token env var was empty — failing
*open* — and its public /health returned repo slugs, branches and commit SHAs
to anyone who knew the hostname. Both are pinned here.
